    "description": "Basic stepping, just like walking up and down stairs, is at the heart of BODYSTEP™ – a full-body cardio workout to really tone your butt and thighs.\n\nIn a BODYSTEP workout you can expect a mixture of upbeat, rhythmic stepping, with squat and lunge patterns to work the legs. Combine this with movements like burpees, push ups and weight plate exercises, and the result is a fun, uplifting, full-body workout! Don’t worry, there’s heaps of options so that everyone leaves feeling successful.\n\nOur bubbly and approachable instructors coach you through the workout. We play invigorating, hit music and inject a whole lot of fun and personality along the way. You can burn up to 620 calories** and you’ll leave buzzing with satisfaction.",
