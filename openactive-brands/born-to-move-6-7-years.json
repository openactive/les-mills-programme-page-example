    "description": "Focusing on fun rather than formal exercise routines, these classes are the ultimate way to introduce fundamental movement skills. During the 30, 45 or 55-minute classes children move and sing their way through the simple choreography. The moves train body awareness, as well as improve balance, coordination and control. The classes are set to music children love and, as children of this age are primarily visual learners, the highly-trained teacher demonstrates moves that they can easily copy.",
